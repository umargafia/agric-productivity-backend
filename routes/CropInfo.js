    description: `Cassava, scientifically known as Manihot esculenta, is a vital crop to the economy of Nigeria. The country is the world's largest producer of cassava, with production occurring in 24 of the country's 36 states. 

In 2017, Nigeria produced 59 million tons of cassava, accounting for approximately 20 percent of global production. The economic potentials of cassava in Nigeria are enormous, with high revenue yields from both domestic value addition and derived income as well as revenues for the government.

Cassava production in Nigeria is well-developed as an organized agricultural crop. It has well-established multiplication and processing techniques for food products and cattle feed. There are more than 40 cassava varieties in use.

The major states in Nigeria which produce cassava are Anambra, Delta, Edo, Benue, Cross River, Imo, Oyo, and Rivers, and to a lesser extent Kwara and Ondo. In 1999, Nigeria produced 33 million tonnes of cassava. As of 2000, the average yield per hectare was 10.6 tonnes.

Cassava is grown throughout the year, making it preferable to the seasonal crops of yam, beans, or peas. It displays an exceptional ability to adapt to climate change, with tolerance to low soil fertility, resistance to drought conditions, pests, and diseases, and suitability to store its roots for long periods underground even after they mature. Use of fertilizers is limited, and it is also grown on fallow lands.

In order to increase production, several varieties of cassava have been developed which are pest resistant; production in the country is hampered by problems with green mite, the cassava mealybug, and the variegated grasshopper.

Cassava farming in Nigeria is a very lucrative business because cassava is one of the staple foods in the country which is consumed by most tribes in Nigeria and serves as the raw material for most daily edible products. There is basically no family in Nigeria that doesn’t consume at least one or two products made from Cassava daily.`,

    description: `Yam production in Nigeria is significant as the country is the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70–76 percent of the world production. In 1985, Nigeria produced 18.3 million tonnes of yam from 1.5 million hectares, representing 73.8 percent of total yam production in Africa. According to 2008 figures, yam production in Nigeria has nearly doubled since 1985, with Nigeria producing 35.017 million metric tonnes with value equivalent of US$5.654 billion.

Yam is in the class of roots and tubers that is a staple of the Nigerian and West African diet, which provides some 200 calories of energy per capital daily. In Nigeria, in many yam-producing areas, it is said that "yam is food and food is yam". However, the production of yam in Nigeria is substantially short and cannot meet the growing demand at its present level of use. It also has an important social status in gatherings and religious functions, which is assessed by the size of yam holdings one possesses.

Yam, a tropical crop in the genus Dioscorea, has as many as 600 species out of which six are economically important staple species. These are: Dioscorea rotundata (white guinea yam), Dioscorea alata (purple yam), Dioscorea bulbifera (aerial yam), Dioscorea dumetorum (trifoliate yam), and Dioscorea esculenta (lesser yam). Out of these, Dioscorea rotundata (white yam) and Dioscorea alata (water yam) are the most common, and most economically important, species in Nigeria.

Yams are grown in the coastal region in rain forests, wood savanna and southern savanna habitats. Other tubers consumed in Nigeria include cassava, sweet potato, Hausa potato, Livingstone potato, and potato.

The farmland production system in Ekiti State consists of wetland (20% farms are under this category), upland (50% farms in this category) types and a combination of the two types (30% by the balance farms). A study carried out on the efficiency of the three systems to improve crop outputs to meet growing demands for this food crop indicates that the "wetland yam based enterprises are the most economically efficient with mean economic efficiency of 0.80 followed by upland yam based enterprises with mean efficiency of 0.79."

Yams are a more significant part of Nigerian history when it comes to food. For ages, yams serve as a source of several dishes such as pounded yam, porridge, roasted yam, fried yam, and so on. The importance of yams in Nigeria is also traced to its economic viability.

    description: `Millet is an important crop in Nigeria, favored due to its productivity and short growing season under dry, high-temperature conditions. Millet is widely grown in Nigeria but more predominantly in Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara, Kano, Jigawa, Bauchi Borno, and other states of Northern Nigeria.

In 2022, the production of millet in Nigeria was estimated to be two million metric tons. Between 2005 and 2021, the millet output in the country decreased significantly. The largest drop in production was registered in 2011 when the crop volume experienced a decrease of over 75 percent compared to 2010.

The world’s millet market value is projected to surpass $12 billion by 2025. Apart from this, the global millet consumption has been forecast to surge between this year and 2024. This is driven by the growing use of millet for snacks, which include flakes, cookies and chips. Besides, the non-food use of millet has increased significantly, especially as an animal feed ingredient and as raw material in breweries and starch industries.

According to estimates, about 60 percent of the millet production is for non-human consumption. However, in recent years, there is a renewed demand for millet as food for health-conscious urban consumers. The Millet Market – 2019–2024 projects that cultivation of millet, known for high nutritive value, will increase.

Dishes like fura, millet pap, millet fufu, acha, are made out of millet in Nigeria. When growing, it resembles a corn on a cob. Among the many reasons for its popularity is its high nutritional value and health benefits, such as helping to manage diabetes and support a healthy heart..

It is drought-tolerant and heat-tolerant, and is especially important in arid regions. It is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the "fifth most important cereal crop grown in the world".

Among the constraints to sorghum production are subsistence farmers who do not invest much in fertilizer and improved varieties, rising labor cost, changing consumer food preferences, bird attacks and parasitic weeds such as Striga. Another major problem is the variable rainfall that leads to wild fluctuations in production..

    description: `Soybeans were introduced to Nigeria in 1908 and the first export was in 1947. The crop is well-suited for Nigeria and is spread equally between the north and middle belt region. Nigeria’s soybeans production is rising steadily spurred by favourable grower prices and high demand. Soybeans have an average protein content of 40%. It is more protein-rich than any of the common vegetable or animal food sources found in Nigeria.

Soybean farming in Nigeria is concentrated in the northern states of the country, with Kaduna, Niger, Katsina, and Taraba being the top producers. The crop is suitable for both rain-fed and irrigated farming, making it a versatile crop that can be grown in various regions.

In 2021-22, Nigerian soybean production was forecasted to reach 1.25 million tonnes, a 43% increase from the most recent 2020-21 estimate. Area harvested is projected at 1.2 million hectares, up 20% from the 2020-21 estimate. Although soybean production is mostly cultivated in the northern parts of the country, Nigeria’s northern states are experiencing security challenges, resulting from Boko Haram activities as well as conflict between pastoralists and farmers. As a result, there is a growing shift by farmers in the south of the country to increase soybean production levels.

Soybean yields have been increasing in recent years, and this is attributed to private sector investors putting money and resources into increasing crop output to meet the growing needs of local feed millers and poultry farmers. Nigeria’s soybean consumption in 2021-22 is forecasted to reach 1.275 million tonnes, up 38% compared to the 2020-21 estimate.

    description: `Cowpea, also known as Black Eyed Pea, is a staple crop in Nigeria. Nigeria is the largest producer of cowpea in Africa, with 4.3 million hectares (36% of the area under cowpea production in SSA) producing over 2.4 million tons (60% of the world total) annually. An average yield of 271.5 kg/ha is reported from the vast area of 3.8 million hectares cultivated to cowpea in Nigeria.

Late last year the world’s first genetically modified (GM) cowpea was registered and approved for release to smallholder farmers in Nigeria. The new variety carries a microbial insecticidal gene making it resistant to a major pest that affects this crop. The decision is significant because this will be the second GM crop commercialised in the country following Bt Cotton, and the first one that is a food crop.

The release of a GM crop in Africa is particularly noteworthy as many countries on the continent are still wary of biotechnology. It is important for another reason too: cowpea, also known as Black Eyed Pea, is an important source of protein for over 200 million people. Nigeria is also the world’s largest producer of cowpea. But it still has to import around 500,000 tonnes to meet internal demand. This is because the potential loss in yield due to insects is over 90%. By controlling one of the major pests – the cowpea pod-borer – the country could become self-sufficient. It could also potentially help reduce rural poverty and hunger.

The new variety, named Sampea 20-T, carries a microbial insecticidal gene from a bacterium and represents a biotechnology product that has been nearly 20 years in the making. It is fully resistant to a damaging pod-borer insect.

    description: `Palm oil is of strategic importance to Nigeria as it is used in the production of more than half of the products sold in supermarkets globally. Nigeria is the largest consumer of palm oil in Africa with a population of 197 million people. The nation consumed approximately 3 million MT of fats and oils in 2018, with palm oil accounting for 44.7% or 1.34 million MT. In the same period, production stood at 1.02 million MT resulting to supply shortfall of 0.32 million MT.

In the early 1960s, Nigeria was the world's largest palm oil producer with a global market share of 43%. Today, it is the 5th largest producer with less than 2% of total global market production of 74.08 million MT. In 1966, Malaysia and Indonesia surpassed Nigeria as the world's largest palm oil producers. Since then, both countries combined produce approximately 80% of total global output, with Indonesia alone responsible for over half i.e. 53.3% of global output.

According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), if Nigeria had maintained its market dominance in the palm oil industry, the country would have been earning approximately $20 billion annually from cultivation and processing of palm oil as at today.

To meet the supply gap of palm oil, the country had to depend on importation over the years. However, in 2015, the CBN published a list of 41 items, including palm oil, as ineligible for forex through the Nigerian interbank market to encourage local production and manage foreign reserves. Also, duty charge of 35% was applied on crude palm oil (CPO).

While this seems good in government's effort at promoting local production of Crude palm oil, it has impact on local manufacturers of refined vegetable oil and this include: Increase in cost of local production of refined vegetable oil; Non-availability of enough palm oil for further refining by local manufacturers thereby resulting to idle capacity utilization; and Non-competitiveness in prices of locally produced refined vegetable oil due to the activities of smugglers of refined vegetable oil into the country.

    description: `Cotton is a major cash crop in Nigeria, with the country once being the world's largest producer of cotton. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Nigeria was home to Africa's largest textile industry, with more than 180 textile mills that employed around 450,000 people and contributed over 25% of the workforce in the manufacturing sector. However, most of those factories have stopped operations today, and textile factories are operating at below 20% capacity with a workforce of less than 20,000 people.

Despite this decline, there are efforts to revive the cotton industry in Nigeria. The government's Anchor Borrowers programme has helped more than 150,000 farmers in Katsina with finance. They are cultivating over 180,000 hectares of cotton that will feed the ginneries. Production is also ongoing across many states, with more to come onboard in the next planting seasons.

The revival of the cotton industry could provide jobs for unemployed Nigerian youths and make Nigeria a global player in textile and apparel. It has the capacity to reduce the country’s $4bn annual imports of textiles and apparel, earn foreign exchange and create more than 2 million jobs.

However, challenges remain. The country's cotton industry has been affected by imports of cheaper brands, a lack of financial support for farmers, and a lack of resilient varieties of cotton seedlings. To address these issues, the Central Bank ordered government agencies to give preference to local content when procuring goods and services and set up the Textile Revival Implementation Committee to drive the recovery of the sector.

    description: `Sugarcane is a significant crop in Nigeria, with the country being the second-largest sugar market in sub-Saharan Africa after South Africa. Nigeria has a population of over 202 million people and per capita consumption of about 8kg. In 2012, the Government of Nigeria approved and launched the National Sugar Master Plan (NSMP), a policy document that contains the strategic roadmap for the development of the sugar sector as well as the enactment of the conducive policy environment for its implementation. The policy positions the sector to attract investments in domestic production through backward integration program, offering credit facilities and tax incentives to investors, while at the same time imposing duties on imported raw and refined sugar.

However, despite these efforts, Nigeria's sugar industry is facing serious challenges. Entrenched interests in the sugar value chain are largely responsible for Nigeria’s sugar production crisis. High transport and production costs for hauling harvested sugarcane to the mills, as well as low-capacity building are additional constraints.

In terms of production volume, Nigeria's sugarcane production was at a level of 1.5 million tonnes in 2021, down from 1.52 million tonnes in the previous year. This represents a change of 1.20%. In some producing countries, marginal quantities of sugarcane are consumed, either directly as food or in the form of juice.

The export price of Sugarcane from Nigeria has seen a steady increase over the past five years. In 2018, the export price per kilogram was $0.45, which increased to $0.50 in 2019. In 2020, the price rose to $0.55, and in 2021 it further increased to $0.60.

It was traditionally grown in the ginger savanna region of Kaduna, particularly in Southern Kaduna. However, research has shown that it can equally do well in the rainforest region.

Nigeria is the second biggest ginger-producing country in the world. In 2021, Nigeria’s ginger production reached 768 thousand tons. There are several major states as centers of ginger production and cultivation. The states include Kaduna, Bauchi, Benue, Gombe, and Nasarawa.

Ginger is well known as a food spice across the world and it is the underground rhizome of a perennial tropical crop. Originally, the plant is a native of South Eastern Asia but over centuries has been introduced to various parts of the world like the Caribbean, the Americas and Africa. Presently, the top growers of the crop includes Jamaica, Indonesia, Fiji etc.

A mature ginger rhizome is fibrous and has a striated texture. The outer skin of the rhizome is brownish in colour while the inner flesh depending on the variety may be red, yellow or white. The commodity is so popular owing to its numbers uses. Some of them are herbal medicines, spices of bread in bakeries, and its uses in breweries to produce drinks among others.

Going by official statistics, Nigeria is currently the third largest exporter of Ginger in the world after China and India. Experts say the Nigerian ginger is highly regarded in the international market for its quality and highly medicinal value. Specifically, its aroma, pungency and high oil and Aleoresin content are other distinct features of ginger products from Nigeria.

    description: `Banana and plantain are among the major staple foods in Nigeria and other nations, providing several nutrients to the body. They constitute a rich energy source, also rich in minerals, dietary fibre, vitamins A, B and C which are needed for healthy growth. It has been estimated that over 100 million Africans derive their food energy requirement from banana and plantain which is a rich source of iron, potassium and carotene and may be dominantly processed into different products for food and snacks.

With 60 percent of the world's production, West Africa is one of the major plantain-producing regions of the world, accounting for about 32% of worldwide production. The major plantain-producing countries in the region include Ghana, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, and Guinea. Banana is also cultivated in West Africa but account for only 2.3% of worldwide production. The major banana-producing countries in the region include Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, and Liberia.

In Nigeria, banana and plantain have become major food and cash crops. Since the last decade, plantain yields in West Africa have experienced slight increases, with the largest production of 3.7 million metric tons in Ghana, contributing about 13.1% to the agricultural Gross Domestic Product. Cote d’lvoire ranks the highest producer of bananas with about 320,000 metric tons in West Africa.

Although plantain production in West Africa is much higher than banana production, banana is presently of greater importance in terms of world trade. Whereas plantain marketing is characterized by small-scale, widely dispersed producers, banana production is generally more centralized, involving larger production firms and a more structured marketing and transportation system.

In West Africa, the sustained production of banana and plantain is endangered by several yield constraining factors including pests and diseases, low technology adoption and environmental factors especially under smallholder management. However, there is room for progress in obtaining bigger yield of these crops. Banana and plantain production enterprises in West Africa have great prospects in the area of employment generation, contributions to national income and gross domestic product, poverty alleviation, economic and industrial growth and rural development..

Tomatoes thrive under these conditions and can be grown in any container, on any roadside, in a garden, or on a farm. 

There are many different varieties of tomatoes, and not all of them will do well in the Nigerian climate. Some of the more popular varieties that are well-suited to the climate include: Roma, Cherry, Beefsteak, and Heirloom tomatoes. The soil should be well-drained, fertile, loose, and sandy for tomatoes to thrive. 

Tomatoes need full sun to produce a good crop. Choose a location in your garden that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight each day. Tomatoes need to be watered regularly, especially during the hot, dry months. Water your plants deeply, and make sure the soil stays moist but not soggy. 

Tomatoes need to be fertilized every few weeks during the growing season. Use a balanced fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and phosphorus. Tomatoes are ripe and ready to be harvested when they are a deep red color. Cut the tomatoes from the vine, and enjoy your delicious crop!

Tomato farming necessitates the use of a good nursery, preparation of the land, transplanting, and growing the best variety. It’s all about timing because plants tend to grow best at specific times of year.

Nigeria is the 14th largest producer of tomatoes in the world and second in Africa. It accounts for about 65 per cent of all tomatoes produced in West Africa. Despite this, Nigeria imports an average of 150,000 tons of tomato paste concentrate annually.

    description: `The paper industry in Nigeria has a rich history but has faced significant challenges in recent years. In the 1970s to 1990s, Nigeria had three paper mills, including the Nigeria Paper Mill (NPM) Limited located in Jebba, Kwara State; Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company (NNMC) Limited, Oku-Iboku, Akwa Ibom State; and Nigerian National Paper Manufacturing Company (NNPMC) Limited in Iwopin, Ogun State. However, only the Iwopin mill is currently producing, and that too at just 10 to 20 percent capacity.

Even if these firms were operating at full capacity today, they could only provide 250,000 metric tons of paper needs as against a demand of over 3 million metric tons. As a result, Nigeria imports a significant amount of its paper needs. In fact, almost all the paper needs by newspaper houses, printers and publishers are met by imports. This raises production costs for these firms due to the devaluation of the Naira.

The importation of papers costs Africa’s largest economy N182 billion annually. This is happening as Nigeria is suffering an acute foreign exchange crisis. However, there is potential for growth in the industry. Experts have recommended that Nigeria needs 50 small-scale paper mills now. They believe that investors with $10 to 50 million should step up and tap opportunities in the paper industry.

Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for growth and revitalization in the industry. For instance, kenaf (a type of plant fiber) is now available all over Nigeria and could serve as a raw material for paper production. The government has also been urged to step up with policies to drive the sub-sector.

In conclusion, while the paper industry in Nigeria faces significant challenges, there are also opportunities for growth and development. With the right investments and policies, Nigeria has the potential to not only meet its domestic paper needs but also become a major player in the global paper industry.
